- **Creation** - "The Creation is the BEING and the NON-BElNG of the life. It is the most immense mass of spiritual energy in the universe. It is spirit in purest form and unmeasurable in its wisdom, in its knowledge, in its love and in its harmony and truth. The Creation is something spiritually dynamic, a pure-spirit-intelligence-energy, ungraspable for human beings, prevailing over all, an at all times active, creative, standing in unstoppable evolution, all gathered into itself, wisdom and love." [[Dekalog/Dodekalog](./references.md#DeD)]
