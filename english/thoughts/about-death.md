# About death

## Be aware that you cannot avoid death as it is inevitable for every living being so that it will meet you in good and not frighten you when you face it. [[GoT 4:104](./references.md/#GoT)]

Many times we sympathize when we see a person who is close to death, maybe a relative who is very sick, or a friend who lives in a danger zone, and that gives us a false sense of assurance against death, thinking that the other person is closer to death than oneself, and the worst thing is that we take an attitude as if it were true, but the reality is that we are not guaranteed anything against death, we can meet the sickest person and we believe that is closer to death, but at any time you can fall off a step and lose your life. So be aware that death is inevitable and that you are not guaranteed life at any time.
